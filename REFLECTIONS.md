Have a nice day!

## Reflections
**Goals:**
I wanted to work on a brand new dataset based on my professional / personal interests - how people use public transport. I do not seek to build statistical models, instead keep to simple summary statistics for the time being.

**What went well and didn't:**
The data cleaning process was more tedious than I thought since Transport for London (the dataset provider) is not entirely consistent in their data structure. However, the cleaning process is still easy to understand and replicable.

**Takeaways:**
I learned to make a rather beautiful sloped graph with just ggplot - quite impressive, at least to me!

**Draft 2:**
I would love to pair this html file with a proper story map, something like: https://bairunnn.github.io/bto-oct-2024-storymap-draft/

And touch up on the figures to make them more aesthetic...
