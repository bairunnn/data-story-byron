Homework Assignment: Create a Reproducible Data-Driven Story

This will be your first attempt at creating one of these. Good news: you don't have to be perfect! Do as much as you can in fine-tuning your R markdown or improving your visuals, but ultimately, this will be a baseline, and hopefully, you will notice an improvement in your work as the semester progresses.

Part 1: The Warm-Up Exercise - Get inspired.

1. Visit the 10 years of Upshot

Links to an external site. page from the New York Times

2. Choose one article that you find interesting or resonates with you. Study how the article communicates insights using data, visuals, and narrative.

3. Create a storyboard for the article.

    Break it down into its core components. 
    Main Insights - what are the key data points or findings the article highlights
    Visuals - what charts, graphs, or interactive elements are used to convey the insight?
    Context & Background - How does the article set up the story? What background information does it provide?
    Transitions - How does the article move from one insight to another? How are the visuals introduced and connected to the narrative?
    Conclusions - What are the takeaways for the reader?

Use a digital tool (like PPT) to create a storyboard mapping out each element and a brief explanation (~200ish words. but I won't be counting) of why you chose the article and what you learned from breaking down its structure.

Part 2: Create your reproducible data story in R Markdown

1. Find an insight that you want to tell a story about. Please don't stress - feel free to use something from another course. You can use a simple census data insight. Check out this book

Links to an external site. where I got the graphs from class. But if your life is easy right now and you want to challenge yourself to some data analysis - go ahead. You will be graded on the communication part, not the fanciness of the statistics. Do what makes sense for you!

2. Develop your narrative:

    Define your Big Idea of your data story. Clearly state your key insight or message you want to convey (it can be to inform - like the NYTimes or it can be more of a style like we did in class and you can pretend-play a scenario.)
    Structure your R Markdown document around this narrative, ensuring a logical flow from context to key insight to conclusion

3. Reproducibility

    Think about package dependencies, any data that must be loaded.
    Set up a GitHub repo for your project and organize your files (data, outputs, scripts)
    Make sure it can run on another person's computer! and that you can open it an run it in 5 years from now.

4. Polish your R Markdown.

    Take some time to explore settings to take your Markdown up one notch! Maybe set a theme! Check out the YAML options.
    Provide any supporting references! Create a .bib file
    Don't make unsubstantiated claims. Back those up!

5. Push your final project to GitHub.

    Don't be late - we need to keep moving on!
    Remember: it doesn't have to be perfect. We will be improving on it!

Deliverables

    Storyboard of Upshot Article
    Link to your GitHub Repo
    A knitted HTML of your Story
    An accompanying reflection on your article (this can be a bulleted list or text. just take a moment to reflect - example things to reflect on below):
        what were you aiming for? 
        what went well, what didn't?
        what did you learn? did you try anything new?
        if you had an infinite amount of time and could make it perfect, what would you like to see improved in the next draft?
